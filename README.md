AMC
==================
__AMC is AutoMagic Coding__ - very easy to use NSCoding replacement for Mac & iOS Projects.
AMC gives you ability to create NSDictionary representation of any supported object, save it in PLIST
(or any other PLIST-compatible file format, i.e. JSON) and load again without writing a lot of code.

AMC uses Objective-C Runtime to determine object's properties automatically & Key-Value-Coding to
get & set them.

Repo Contents
-------------------------------------

* __AutoMagicCoding/__ - contains all AMC sources, that you need to import to your project.
* __Tests/__ - contains all AMC Unit Tests sources.
   * __ObjectsForTests/__ - contains test classes, that are used in Unit Tests. Good examples how to use AMC.
* __SupportingFiles/__ - Xcode stuff (Info.plists, xibs, main.m, etc...)
* AutoMagicCoding.xcodeproj - Mac Xcode Project for testing AMC on Mac.
* AutoMagicCoding-iOS.xcodeproj - iOS Xcode Project for testing AMC on iOS.
* README.md - contains text that you're reading right now. ;)

Supported properties types
-------------------------------------
 * AMC Enabled Objects.
 * Common Collections (NSArray, NSMutableArray, NSDictionary, NSMutableDictionary)
 * Custom Collections (Mutable/Not-Mutable, that can be used as keyValue(Dictionary) or Ordered(Array) collections )
    * Note: Custom and/or Mutable Collections will not be recognized inside of collections itself. Ordered collections will be treated as NSArray, keyValue collections will be treated as NSDictionary.
 * Common Structures (NSRect/CGRect, NSSize/CGSize, NSPoint/CGPoint).
 * Custom Structures (You will need to write additional code to encode/decode them to/from NSString).
 
File Format
-------------------------------------  

AMC saves object to NSDictionary, that can be saved to PLIST (or JSON).   
Keys simply are ivars names and/or properties names.   
One special key ( "class" ) used to hold name of the object's class.   
Run unit tests on Mac & go look to your Documents folder - there will be a lot of PLISTs.   
They are test objects saved to PLIST files. 

Known Issues
==================
 * Structures can't be iVars - they must be used in AMC as properties (Issue #10) .
 * There's some troubles in Xcode running Unit Tests on iOS. See Issue #9 for details.

How To Use
==================
 1. Drag'n'Drop NSObject+AutoMagicCoding.h | m to your project. This will add AMC methods to all objects
 inherited from NSObject.
 2. Import NSObject+AutoMagicCoding.h where you need it.
 3. Reimplement +(BOOL)AMCEnabled and return YES to enable AMC for all instances of your class.
 4. Reimplement -(id)initWithDictionaryRepresentation: and use [super initWithDictionaryRepresentation] inside of it. Ensure that all collections & other fields are created
 after calling super initWithDictionaryRepresentation. Do your own init routines after.
 4. Use -dictionaryRepresentation to encode your object to NSDictionary & NSObject::objectWithDictionaryRepresentation: to decode.
 * __Additionaly:__ reimplement -AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation to change amount & order of encoded/decoded fields. (See AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation below for more info ).
 * __Additionaly:__ reimplement -AMCEncodeStructWithValue:withName: & -AMCDecodeStructWithValue: withName: to support custom structs (See Custom Struct below for more info).
 * __Additionaly:__ reimplement -AMCFieldTypeForValueWithKey: for any non-scalar ivars, that you want to use
 as fields for AMC. 
 
 __ATTENTION__: It's recommended to avoid using iVars without properties in AMC due to
 harder memory management, need to write more code, unsupported custom structs & possible future restrictions.
 
AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation  
==================  

 -AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation returns NSArray of NSStrings, thar are passed to KVC methods
 to get & set fields of AMCEnabled objects.
 Default implementation returns complete set of all object properties (both readonly & readwrite),
 including properties declared by superclasses (NSObject's properties are not included).
 Reimplement this method to choose manually, what properties should be encoded/decoded by AMC.
 See tests in "Tests" folder for more info & usage examples.
 
Custom Struct Support   
==================  
 
To support your own custom structs you must do the following:

1. Your custom structs should be used __ONLY AS PROPERTIES__ in your classes. iVars custom structs are not supported.
2. Reimplement -AMCEncodeStructWithValue:withName: & AMCDecodeStructFromString:withName: like this: 

```
- (NSString *) AMCEncodeStructWithValue: (NSValue *) structValue withName: (NSString *) structName
{
    if ([structName isEqualToString: @"CustomStruct" ])
    {
        CustomStruct custom;
        [structValue getValue: &custom]; 
        
        return NSStringFromCustomStruct(custom);
    }
    
    return [super AMCEncodeStructWithValue: structValue withName: structName];
}

- (NSValue *) AMCDecodeStructFromString: (NSString *)value withName: (NSString *) structName
{
    if ([structName isEqualToString: @"CustomStruct" ])
    {
        CustomStruct custom = CustomStructFromNSString(value);
        return [NSValue valueWithBytes: &custom objCType:@encode(CustomStruct)];
    }
    
    return [super AMCDecodeStructFromString: value withName: structName];
}
```

See FooWithStructs & AMCTestSimple for working example.


Exceptions
==================

All exceptions, bad-data & unwanted behaviour tests are located in AMCExceptions.m. 

Here's a list of bad things, that can happen with AMC:   

* __Encoding__ ( calling -dictionaryRepresentation )
   1. **Unsupported struct**: throws AMCEncodeException (See Custom Struct Support above).
   2. **Wrong keys in -AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation**: Throws NSUnkownKeyException.( Wrong key = no such property, ivar or method - see KVC programming guide for details).
   3. **KVC bug/failure, when using -valueForKey: with method/property on struct with size that is not multiple of 4**: Throws AMCKeyValueCodingFailureException (Issue #19).
* __Decoding__ ( calling +objectWithDictionaryRepresentation: & -initWithDictionaryRepresentation: )
   1. **Unsupported struct**: Throws AMCDecodeException (See Custom Struct Support above).
   2. **Mismatch between -AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation & Dictionary Representation Keys**: No exceptions gets thrown. Only intersect of keys in 
   dictionary representation & -AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation are used to set values for decoding object's fields. So always check for neccessery fields in your -initWithDictionaryRepresentation and create them if they are nil.
   3. **Object for Scalar key in Dictionary Representation**: KVC will throw NSInvalidArgumentException i.e. if you're trying to set Object with it's own dictionary representation as simple int.
   4. **Scalar for Object key in Dictionary Representation**: No exception gets thrown. Object will not be set - so your property will still handle nil.
   5. **Object with different class name for Object Key in Dictionary Representation**: No exception gets thrown. I.e. it's possible to set Foo instance for Bar class property with AMC. Their own properties can be set with AMC or remain nil. Do [self.foo isKindOfClass: [Foo class]] checks in -initWithDictinoaryRepresentation: after calling super if it's necessary.
   
AMC_NO_THROW
------------------

You can define AMC_NO_THROW to disable exceptions throw by following methods:

* +objectWithDictionaryRepresentation:
* -initWithDictionaryRepresentation:
* -loadValueForKey:fromDictionaryRepresentation:
* -dictionaryRepresentation   

With AMC_NO_THROW defined they will simply return nil and/or do nothing instead.   
-AMCDecodeStructFromString:withName: & -AMCEncodeStructWithValue:withName: can 
throw exceptions even if AMC_NO_THROW is defined. Don't catch any exceptions in 
your reimplementations of these methods - you don't need to call them directly, so AMC
will catch their exceptions for you.
